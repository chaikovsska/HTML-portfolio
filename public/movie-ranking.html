<h1>The Best Movies According To Sofiia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mulholland Dr. (2001)</h3>
<p>
    It’s a movie filled with mystery, and with mysterious interlocking pieces. 
    No matter how many know-it-all explainers you read, its corners will never fit together neatly: There are too many ragged edges, and too many that shift shape even as you scrutinize them. 
    It’s strange, exhilarating, and haunting, a requiem for every Hollywood dream that never comes true.

<h3>Little Women (2019)</h3>
<p>
    Gerwig’s Little Women is proof that there are always new ways to tell old stories, ensuring that they live far beyond our own preoccupations and tastes, never becoming last season’s outmoded gown.
</p>
<h3>Once Upon a Time in…Hollywood (2019)</h3>
<p>
    The film is an ode to a place with ghosts in and around every corner: they’re right there in the margins of old cop shows like Mannix and Banyon, like genies in YouTube bottles; 
    they lurk in the beads of condensation on a Musso & Frank’s martini glass, happy to participate, in their own small way, in modern happy hours.
